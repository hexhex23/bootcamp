# Merlion Learns to Code
Merlion Learns to Code is a web application that allows users to search for technology bootcamps in Singapore. This is a simple CRUD application, using Express (framework) and MongoDB (NoSQL database). This application also allows users to sign up through a simple registration.

## Outline
### Unrestricted Access
Prospective students are able to use a search form to enter criteria for the bootcamps they are seeking. They are then directed to a summarised version of results and can also choose to view the full details of a result they are interested in.

This part of the application uses:
* READ

### User Restricted Access
Users can sign up so that they are able to "favourite" courses that they are interested in.

This part of the application uses:
* READ
* UPDATE

### Admin Restricted Access
Administrators can add new courses and amend and/or delete existing courses.

This application allows administrators to sign up although this would be unlikely in a real-life situation. This was done so that people interested in this project can have access to this part of the application by signing up.

This part of the application uses:
* CREATE
* READ
* UPDATE
* DELETE
